<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a final year M.S. student in the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles at Tongji University, co-advised by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r_XUM78AAAAJ) and [Prof. Zhuoping Yu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37402463600). I also work closely with [Dr. Yuanjian Zhang](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/aae/staff/yuanjian-zhang/).

Intelligent reasoning is the key to safe and trustworthy autonomy. My primary research interests are the reasoning process (i.e. interactive prediction, decision-making, and planning) of autonomous systems, which can endow connected autonomous vehicles with the ability to intelligently interact and cooperate with others.

# üèì Miscellaneous
- When I was a child, I am impressed by the consummate skills of [Takumi Fujiwara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_D) and pure freedom when he get to explore the speeds with his car [AE86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_AE86) in [*Initial D*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_D). Therefore, I am really interested in how to endow every machine on roads with the ability to drive like a skillful human driver, even like [Takumi Fujiwara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_D). 
- Besides, I like playing ping pong, and I am good at [penhold grip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_styles). Now, I am learning to use the [shakehand grip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_styles) for offense and defense. 
- I am also a big fan of guitar, especially [Fingerstyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerstyle_guitar). My favorite acoustic guitarist is [Tommy Emmanuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Emmanuel).
